Gathers the example projects linked to the blog https://developpeur-pascal.fr/

Unless otherwise stated, you are free to use them for your own developments under Delphi, respecting the distribution license.

If you have any questions related to these sources and the corresponding page of the blog is not enough for you, don't hesitate to [contact me](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/nous-contacter.php) or [open a discussion](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/exemples/discussions).

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

A lot of other project samples and features coded with Delphi are available in [this code repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-samples).

## What is Delphi?

If you are not familiar with Delphi and the Pascal language, take advantage of the Academic Edition (for students, teachers and educational institutions) or the Community Edition (free for personal use) available at Embarcadero (under the heading "free tools").
You can also test Delphi in your company with the evaluation version.

This free french online course will teach you the basics of programming with Pascal and Delphi even if you have never learned to program:

You also can check https://learndelphi.org web site for other ressources in english.

Online conferences and webinars (technical points on specific topics) are organised regularly.

In French, check out [the schedule of these webinars](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/webinaires.html) and watch [Delphi webinar replays](https://serialstreameur.fr/webinaires-delphi.php).
In English or other languages check https://www.embarcadero.com/events

[Live coding sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or [the Pascal Developpeur YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DeveloppeurPascal/featured) are also organised regularly. For Twitch you can check [the weekly schedule](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin/schedule). For replays of all this, just go to the [live coding section](https://serialstreameur.fr/live-coding.php) of [Serial Streamer](https://serialstreameur.fr/) where you will find many videos in French for software developers, mobile applications, websites and video games.

Finally, if you prefer reading to video, you can find all the recent books published on Delphi and the Pascal language at [Delphi Books](https://delphi-books.com).

## Talks and conferences

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.

## Using this software

[Visit the software website](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/devlog.html) to find out more about how it works, access videos and articles, find out about the different versions available and their features, contact user support...

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/exemples).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies) must be installed in the ./Libraries/librairies

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/exemples/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
